Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST),
find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q
as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants
(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
